# TSUMGI

TSUMGI is a deployment-agnostic compute fabric for scheduling capability-based workloads across heterogeneous compute nodes.

> **Name transition:** TSUMGI is the project name. Existing `astrumweaver` runtime identifiers are unchanged in this phase. See [Naming and compatibility](docs/naming.md).

It is GPU-first, but its control-plane contracts are intentionally not tied to LLMs, a particular accelerator generation, Proxmox, or a one-GPU-per-worker topology.

> **Project status:** early v0.1 architecture/bootstrap. Interfaces may change until the first stable worker/control contract is accepted.
>
> **Candidate status:** [v0.1.0-rc.1 release notes](docs/releases/v0.1.0-rc.1.md) and [qualification gates](docs/rc-qualification-v0.1.0-rc.1.md) are in **preparation only**. No tag, published prerelease or production rollout is authorized.

## Start here

If you want to **install and run TSUMGI**, start with these two pages:

1. [Installation](docs/installation.md) — choose NixOS or generic systemd and install the Control/Worker packages.
2. [Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md) — bring up Control + one Worker and complete a real `debug.echo` job.

The recommended first deployment is deliberately simple:

```text
PostgreSQL → Control → Worker → debug.echo
```

Verify this path before adding Ollama, llama.cpp, vLLM, FreeToken, or ExLlamaV3.
That keeps base TSUMGI installation problems separate from model-runtime
problems.

Current supported installation paths are:

- **NixOS x86_64-linux:** flake + NixOS module — recommended.
- **Other systemd Linux x86_64:** Nix `#installer` package + first-run TUI.
  The standard llama.cpp RuntimeBackend is provisioned through a separate
  TSUMGI-managed Nix profile; see
  [Installation — RuntimeBackend Nix profile](docs/installation.md#runtimebackend-nix-profile).
- **pip-only:** useful for development, but not currently a complete supported host deployment.

TSUMGI assumes the Linux node, networking, PostgreSQL service, GPU
passthrough/device exposure, and NVIDIA host driver already exist.


## Scope

TSUMGI owns the compute-fabric layer:

- durable job/control state
- worker registration, health, drain, and lifecycle state
- capability- and resource-aware scheduling
- job leases, fencing, retries, and recovery
- accelerator identity verification
- executor lifecycle
- deployment of TSUMGI services onto an existing Linux node
- job result/artifact metadata needed by the fabric

TSUMGI does **not** provision the infrastructure underneath a node. In particular, it does not create or configure:

- virtual machines or containers
- bare-metal operating systems
- Proxmox VM/LXC IDs
- bridges, VLANs, or site routing
- IOMMU or PCI passthrough
- host storage pools
- NVIDIA host drivers

A node enters TSUMGI only after the surrounding infrastructure already satisfies the [Host Prerequisite Contract](docs/host-contract.md).

## Architecture boundary

```text
Infrastructure / virtualization layer
(Proxmox, another hypervisor, bare metal, cloud, ...)
                    │
                    │ already-provisioned Linux node
                    ▼
        ┌────────────────────────┐
        │         TSUMGI         │
        │                        │
        │  Control ─── Workers   │
        │             │          │
        │             └ Executors│
        └────────────────────────┘
```

Proxmox is a supported deployment environment, not a TSUMGI dependency. A Proxmox VM, a Proxmox LXC, a bare-metal Linux host, or another Linux VM may all become workers when they satisfy the same host contract.

## Design principles

- **Worker != GPU.** A worker is the smallest scheduler-visible exclusive compute unit.
- One worker may own one or several accelerator UUIDs.
- Hardware topology and workload capability are separate concepts.
- LLM, System-One/decision, TTS, image generation, and future workload types are executor capabilities, not control-plane special cases.
- Public configuration examples contain placeholders only; real site inventory, addresses, credentials, and GPU UUIDs stay outside the repository.
- Existing development machines may later participate as drainable/borrowable workers without reprovisioning.

## Documentation
- [Release readiness and deployment decision boundaries](docs/release-readiness.md) — candidate selection, verification and operator gates; not a release authorization.
- [Operator rollout and recovery gates](docs/operator-rollout-gates.md) — service identity, PostgreSQL restoration, existing-version rollback and site go/no-go; production use requires explicit approval.
