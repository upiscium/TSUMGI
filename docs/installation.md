# Installation

This page answers one question: **how do I put TSUMGI on a machine?**

If this is your first installation, read [Getting Started](getting-started.md)
after this page. It walks through a minimal Control + Worker deployment and a
real `debug.echo` job.

> TSUMGI is still pre-v1. The supported installation paths are currently
> intentionally narrow.

## Supported installation paths

| Host | Installation path | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NixOS x86_64-linux | Flake + NixOS module | Recommended / first-class |
| Other systemd Linux x86_64 | `#installer` Nix profile + first-run TUI | Recommended / supported |
| pip-only deployment | Python package only | Not a complete host installation |
| Docker/Kubernetes | — | Not currently provided |

TSUMGI does not install an operating system, PostgreSQL server, NVIDIA
host driver, VM/LXC, PCI passthrough, or hypervisor configuration.

## Before installing

Decide which role the machine will run:

- **Control** — durable scheduler/API; requires PostgreSQL.
- **Worker** — executes jobs; connects to Control.
- **Control + Worker** — valid for a small/smoke deployment.

For a GPU Worker, the host must already have a functioning NVIDIA driver and:

```sh
nvidia-smi
```

must work before TSUMGI installation.

For Control, prepare:

- a PostgreSQL database
- a Worker authority token
- a Client authority token when Client API auth is `bearer`

Client API authentication is explicit:

```toml
[control]
client_auth = "bearer" # or "none"
```

If the setting is omitted, Control defaults to `bearer`, preserving the
existing secure behavior. In bearer mode the Client and Worker tokens must be
different. In `none` mode, Client submit/read/cancel endpoints have no
TSUMGI bearer requirement, so protect them with the intended network,
VPN, reverse proxy, or upstream authentication boundary.

A convenient way to create bearer tokens is:

```sh
openssl rand -hex 32
openssl rand -hex 32
```

Keep them outside the repository.

## PostgreSQL prerequisite

**For TSUMGI v0.1, use PostgreSQL 17.x.** The repository CI currently
runs the durable Control integration tests against PostgreSQL 17, so PostgreSQL
17 is the validated and recommended major version. Within that major version,
use the latest available PostgreSQL 17 minor release.

Other PostgreSQL major versions may work, but they are not currently covered by
TSUMGI CI and should be treated as unvalidated rather than supported.

**Both the target PostgreSQL database encoding and the client connection
encoding MUST be `UTF8`.** Check `SHOW server_encoding;` and
`SHOW client_encoding;` on the intended connection before applying migrations.
The migration entrypoint rejects SQL_ASCII and any other unsupported encoding
**before executing schema changes**; every Control database connection is
checked before any repository read/write or readiness operation.
A database created with an unsupported encoding must be migrated to a freshly
provisioned compatible UTF8 database using an operator-reviewed backup/restore
procedure, not modified blindly in place. See [issue #108](https://github.com/upiscium/TSUMGI/issues/108).

TSUMGI does not provision PostgreSQL. You may use an existing local,
remote, or managed PostgreSQL 17 instance.

For a simple local PostgreSQL installation where you have the usual
`postgres` administrator account, one possible bootstrap is:

```sh
sudo -u postgres createuser --pwprompt astrumweaver
sudo -u postgres createdb --owner astrumweaver astrumweaver
```

Then the Control connection string has the general shape:

```text
postgresql://astrumweaver:PASSWORD@DB_HOST:5432/astrumweaver
```

This is only a database bootstrap example. PostgreSQL authentication,
backups, TLS, HA, and network policy remain deployment/operator
responsibilities.

TSUMGI schema creation/upgrades are separate: run
`astrumweaver-migrate`, or explicitly enable the NixOS
`migrateOnStart` option described below.

## Where configuration files live

The final paths differ by deployment method.

### NixOS

With the NixOS modules, **do not create `control.toml` or `worker.toml`
manually**. Non-secret configuration is declared in Nix under
`services.astrumweaver.control` / `services.astrumweaver.worker`; the module
generates the TOML in the Nix store and points the systemd service at it.

Secret environment files are ordinary host files outside the Nix store. The
examples in this guide use:

```text
/etc/astrumweaver/control.env
/etc/astrumweaver/worker.env
```

and reference those exact paths through `environmentFile`.

### Generic systemd Linux

For the setup wrappers, `control.toml`, `control.env`, `worker.toml`, and
`worker.env` are **input/source files**. They may initially live anywhere
convenient, for example a temporary setup directory in your home directory:

```text
~/astrumweaver-setup/control.toml
~/astrumweaver-setup/control.env
~/astrumweaver-setup/worker.toml
~/astrumweaver-setup/worker.env
```

Pass those paths to the setup wrapper with `--config` and
`--environment-file`. The wrapper copies them into the canonical runtime
locations:

```text
/etc/astrumweaver/control.toml
/etc/astrumweaver/control.env
/etc/astrumweaver/worker.toml
/etc/astrumweaver/worker.env
```

A RuntimeProvider deployment manifest, when used, is installed as:

```text
/etc/astrumweaver/runtime-deployment.json
```

After a successful generic-systemd install, systemd reads the canonical
`/etc/astrumweaver/` copies, not the original setup-directory files.

Keep `*.env` files out of Git. They contain authority/database credentials.

The role-separated defaults in this section apply to the **generic systemd
helpers only**. The NixOS modules are unchanged and retain their existing
configurable `user`, `group`, and state-directory behavior; this is not a claim
of global NixOS role isolation.

For generic systemd, `/etc/astrumweaver` is shared as `root:astrumweaver-config`
with mode `0710`: `astrumweaver-config` is a **traverse-only** supplementary
group, not a file-reading group. Role-managed files are `root:<role-group>`
with mode `0640`, so Control and Worker cannot read each other's files. The
defaults are deliberately different:

- Control uses `astrumweaver-control` for both `User=` and `Group=`, and
  `/var/lib/astrumweaver-control` for its state and home.
- Worker remains `astrumweaver` for both `User=` and `Group=`, and keeps
  `/var/lib/astrumweaver` for its state and home so existing runtime behavior is
  preserved.

Both services have `SupplementaryGroups=astrumweaver-config`; neither service
gets the other role's private group. Distinct custom `--user` accounts are
supported, in either install order, but equal Control and Worker values are
rejected. An existing live account must have the same-name group as its
primary group, with the matching GID. If the account is absent but that
same-name group was pre-provisioned and is empty,
the helper reuses it with `useradd --gid`; it does not reuse a peer or shared
role group. See the exact [Control unit template](../systemd/astrumweaver-control.service.in)
and [Worker unit template](../systemd/astrumweaver-worker.service.in).

## Option A — NixOS

Add TSUMGI as a flake input:

```nix
{
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";
    astrumweaver.url = "github:upiscium/TSUMGI";
  };

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, astrumweaver, ... }: {
    nixosConfigurations.my-host = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
      system = "x86_64-linux";

      modules = [
        astrumweaver.nixosModules.default
        ./configuration.nix
      ];
    };
  };
}
```

Then configure the role in `configuration.nix`.

### Control

Minimal Control module:

```nix
{
  services.astrumweaver.control = {
    enable = true;

    clientAuth = "bearer"; # secure default; use "none" only intentionally

    settings.control = {
      host = "127.0.0.1";
      port = 9000;
    };

    environmentFile = "/etc/astrumweaver/control.env";

    # Convenient for a first deployment. Production operators may prefer
    # explicit migration execution instead.
    migrateOnStart = true;
  };
}
```

Create the local protected configuration directory if this is the first
TSUMGI service on the host:

```sh
sudo install -d -m 0750 /etc/astrumweaver
```

Then create `/etc/astrumweaver/control.env` outside the Nix store.
For `clientAuth = "bearer"`:

```text
ASTRUMWEAVER_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@DB_HOST:5432/astrumweaver
ASTRUMWEAVER_CLIENT_TOKEN=REPLACE_WITH_CLIENT_TOKEN
ASTRUMWEAVER_WORKER_TOKEN=REPLACE_WITH_WORKER_TOKEN
```

For `clientAuth = "none"`, omit the Client token entirely:

```text
ASTRUMWEAVER_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@DB_HOST:5432/astrumweaver
ASTRUMWEAVER_WORKER_TOKEN=REPLACE_WITH_WORKER_TOKEN
```

Protect it:

```sh
sudo chown root:root /etc/astrumweaver/control.env
sudo chmod 600 /etc/astrumweaver/control.env
```

### Minimal Worker

For the first smoke test, use the built-in `debug.echo` executor. It avoids
mixing TSUMGI installation problems with model-runtime problems.

```nix
{
  services.astrumweaver.worker = {
    enable = true;

    workerId = "worker-smoke";
    workerClass = "cpu";
    controlUrl = "http://127.0.0.1:9000";

    capabilities = [ "debug.echo" ];

    gpuUuids = [ ];
    totalVramMb = 0;
    maxSingleGpuVramMb = 0;

    executorFactory =
      "astrumweaver.executors.structured_echo:create_executor";

    environmentFile = "/etc/astrumweaver/worker.env";
  };
}
```

Create `/etc/astrumweaver/worker.env`:

```text
ASTRUMWEAVER_WORKER_TOKEN=REPLACE_WITH_THE_SAME_WORKER_TOKEN_USED_BY_CONTROL
```

Then rebuild:

```sh
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#my-host
```

Continue with [Getting Started](getting-started.md#verify-the-installation).

### GPU + RuntimeProvider Worker

After the smoke Worker succeeds, replace the manual `executorFactory` path
with `runtime.enable = true`.

RuntimeProvider deployment is documented in:

- [Nix Packaging and NixOS Modules](nix.md#first-class-runtimeprovider-execution)
- [Runtime Providers and Execution Demand](runtime-providers.md)
- [Runtime Deployment GPU Isolation Acceptance](runtime-deployment-acceptance.md)

Do not configure both `executorFactory` and `runtime.enable = true`.

## Option B — generic systemd Linux with Nix

This path does **not** require a source checkout.

It assumes the host already has Nix with the `nix-command` and `flakes`
features available. TSUMGI does not bootstrap Nix itself.

### Recommended: first-run TUI

Install the combined first-run package:

```sh
NIX_BIN="$(command -v nix)"
sudo "$NIX_BIN" profile add \
  --profile /nix/var/nix/profiles/astrumweaver-installer \
  github:upiscium/TSUMGI#installer
```

Then run:

```sh
sudo /nix/var/nix/profiles/astrumweaver-installer/bin/astrumweaver-setup-tui
```

The first-run Control phase asks for `bearer` or `none`. Bearer is the
default. If `none` is selected, the TUI does not generate, request, or write
an `ASTRUMWEAVER_CLIENT_TOKEN`; only the Worker authority token remains in
the protected Control environment file.

The installer-profile TUI entrypoint is a packaging wrapper. It passes the
lexical profile `bin` directory explicitly into first-run setup, so Python
console-script `sys.argv[0]` and the ambient `PATH` are not used to discover
the setup helpers. The same stable profile paths are passed as the persistent
Control/Worker daemon executables in the generated systemd units. A profile
upgrade therefore changes the symlink target without changing unit text.

Do not put a `/nix/store/...` daemon path into a generic systemd unit. If an
older installation already has a store-pinned `ExecStart`, setup refuses to
replace it; follow [the reviewed legacy-unit migration procedure](deployment.md#migrating-an-older-generic-systemd-installation)
first.

The default TUI mode is `first-run`. It can wrap the common bootstrap work
that would otherwise require several manual commands:

```text
choose Control / Worker / Control+Worker
        ↓
Control settings + hidden PostgreSQL URL input
        ↓
generate or enter distinct authority tokens
        ↓
write canonical Control config/env
        ↓
run astrumweaver-migrate
        ↓
install/start Control and wait for /v1/ready
        ↓
discover NVIDIA GPU UUID/VRAM/compute capability
        ↓
select Worker GPU ownership
        ↓
generate Worker config/env
        ↓
install Worker systemd integration
        ↓
smoke debug.echo OR reviewed RuntimeProvider setup
        ↓
wait for Worker registration/readiness
```

Secret prompts use no-echo input. Secret values are omitted from the displayed
review/digest and are written only through the protected environment-file path.

The TUI does **not** provision PostgreSQL itself, install/replace NVIDIA host
drivers, configure PCI passthrough, or mutate hypervisor configuration.

For an already-installed generic-systemd Worker where you only want
RuntimeProvider setup, use:

```sh
sudo /nix/var/nix/profiles/astrumweaver-installer/bin/astrumweaver-setup-tui \
  --mode runtime \
  --driver astrumweaver.setup.systemd:create_systemd_driver
```

This mode migrates the installed canonical smoke Worker rather than asking you
to re-enter Worker ID, Control URL, GPU ownership or resource facts. It reads
the non-secret Worker TOML and canonical unit, verifies them against local GPU
discovery, and preserves the protected `worker.env` only by reference; token
values are never read. Mixed/custom execution authority or unrelated unit
drift fails closed. The reviewed plan stops the smoke Worker before changing
its execution authority, then restarts the same Worker under the selected
RuntimeProvider.

The manual commands below remain documented for troubleshooting,
non-interactive deployment, and understanding exactly what the TUI wraps.

### RuntimeBackend Nix profile

For generic systemd, RuntimeBackend packages are kept separate from the
installer/Control/Worker profiles. The release-blocking standard path currently
covers **llama.cpp**.

When the TUI selects `llama-cpp`, the first-party systemd driver uses the
packaged runtime-profile manager to reconcile:

```text
/nix/var/nix/profiles/astrumweaver-runtime-llama-cpp
```

against the exact TSUMGI candidate that provided the TUI. That candidate
exports:

```text
#runtime-llama-cpp = nixpkgs llama-cpp-cuda
```

so this path is explicitly GPU-capable; it does not rely on the ambiguous
plain `llama-cpp` nixpkgs default.

The Worker deployment manifest stores the stable executable path:

```text
/nix/var/nix/profiles/astrumweaver-runtime-llama-cpp/bin/llama-server
```

The package preflight verifies the dedicated profile's Nix provenance. An
unrelated `llama-server` found through the root shell's or service's ambient
`PATH` does **not** satisfy the prerequisite.

For the normal TUI flow, do not install llama.cpp manually first. Dry-run shows
the runtime package as satisfied or needing apply; after the exact SetupPlan is
approved, the packaged helper installs or upgrades the dedicated profile and a
rerun converges to satisfied state.

You can inspect the profile explicitly:

```sh
sudo /nix/var/nix/profiles/astrumweaver-installer/bin/astrumweaver-runtime-profile \
  status llama-cpp
```

After intentionally upgrading the TSUMGI installer profile to a newer
candidate, explicitly move the runtime profile to that same candidate with:

```sh
sudo /nix/var/nix/profiles/astrumweaver-installer/bin/astrumweaver-runtime-profile \
  upgrade llama-cpp
```

The runtime profile has its own Nix generations. To return to its previous
generation:

```sh
sudo /nix/var/nix/profiles/astrumweaver-installer/bin/astrumweaver-runtime-profile \
  rollback llama-cpp
```

Rollback is deliberately operator-owned. A newer TUI still expects its own
candidate; applying that newer reviewed SetupPlan again will reconcile the
runtime profile forward. If you intentionally keep a rolled-back runtime,
keep the corresponding TSUMGI candidate/runtime contract aligned as
well.

Do not add unrelated packages to the
`astrumweaver-runtime-llama-cpp` profile. TSUMGI owns that profile as a
single-runtime boundary.

The `ASTRUMWEAVER_RUNTIME_INSTALLERS_JSON` and
`ASTRUMWEAVER_RUNTIME_VERIFIERS_JSON` argv maps remain available for
advanced/custom deployments and for providers without a first-party managed
Nix RuntimeBackend. They are not the normal llama.cpp installation path.

### Manual Control package


```sh
NIX_BIN="$(command -v nix)"
sudo "$NIX_BIN" profile add \
  --profile /nix/var/nix/profiles/astrumweaver-control \
  github:upiscium/TSUMGI#control
```

The profile contains:

- `astrumweaver-control`
- `astrumweaver-migrate`
- `astrumweaver-setup-control-plane`
- host-integration assets

Check it:

```sh
/nix/var/nix/profiles/astrumweaver-control/bin/astrumweaver-control --help
```

Prepare a non-secret `control.toml`:

```toml
[control]
host = "127.0.0.1"
port = 9000
worker_ttl_seconds = 60
lease_seconds = 300
maintenance_interval_seconds = 5
access_log = false
```

Prepare `control.env`:

```text
ASTRUMWEAVER_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@DB_HOST:5432/astrumweaver
ASTRUMWEAVER_CLIENT_TOKEN=REPLACE_WITH_CLIENT_TOKEN
ASTRUMWEAVER_WORKER_TOKEN=REPLACE_WITH_WORKER_TOKEN
```

Apply database migrations before first startup:

```sh
sudo env \
  ASTRUMWEAVER_DATABASE_URL='postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@DB_HOST:5432/astrumweaver' \
  /nix/var/nix/profiles/astrumweaver-control/bin/astrumweaver-migrate
```

Install and start the service:

```sh
sudo /nix/var/nix/profiles/astrumweaver-control/bin/astrumweaver-setup-control-plane \
  --config ./control.toml \
  --environment-file ./control.env \
  --executable /nix/var/nix/profiles/astrumweaver-control/bin/astrumweaver-control \
  --start
```

### Manual Worker package

Install the Worker package:

```sh
NIX_BIN="$(command -v nix)"
sudo "$NIX_BIN" profile add \
  --profile /nix/var/nix/profiles/astrumweaver-worker \
  github:upiscium/TSUMGI#worker
```

Check it:

```sh
/nix/var/nix/profiles/astrumweaver-worker/bin/astrumweaver-worker --help
```

The current packaged generic setup wrapper is GPU-worker oriented. Confirm the
available GPUs:

```sh
nvidia-smi --query-gpu=uuid,memory.total,name --format=csv,noheader,nounits
```

Create `worker.toml` using the selected GPU facts:

```toml
[worker]
id = "worker-gpu-smoke"
class = "gpu-single"
control_url = "http://CONTROL_HOST:9000"
capabilities = ["debug.echo"]
gpu_uuids = ["GPU-REPLACE-ME"]
gpu_count = 1
total_vram_mb = 24576
max_single_gpu_vram_mb = 24576
max_concurrency = 1
health_host = "127.0.0.1"
health_port = 9100

[executor]
factory = "astrumweaver.executors.structured_echo:create_executor"

[executor.settings]
```

Create `worker.env`:

```text
ASTRUMWEAVER_WORKER_TOKEN=REPLACE_WITH_THE_SAME_WORKER_TOKEN_USED_BY_CONTROL
```

Install the service:

```sh
sudo /nix/var/nix/profiles/astrumweaver-worker/bin/astrumweaver-setup-gpu-worker \
  --config ./worker.toml \
  --environment-file ./worker.env \
  --executable /nix/var/nix/profiles/astrumweaver-worker/bin/astrumweaver-worker \
  --start
```

The setup wrapper reads the selected GPU UUID sequence only from
`worker.toml`'s `[worker].gpu_uuids`. There is intentionally no separate
`--gpu-uuid` setup argument; `/etc/astrumweaver/gpu-uuids` is generated from
that canonical Worker configuration for systemd preflight/isolation.

`--gpu-isolation auto` is the default. If the host exposes additional GPUs,
the setup path attempts to isolate the selected physical GPU set through the
Worker systemd cgroup. If it cannot prove the mapping/isolation, setup fails
closed.

For a RuntimeProvider-backed Worker, first establish the base Worker service,
then use the reviewed RuntimeProvider setup path described in
[Interactive Worker/runtime Setup TUI](setup-tui.md) and
[Existing-Node Deployment](deployment.md).

## Upgrading

### NixOS

Update the flake input and rebuild:

```sh
nix flake update astrumweaver
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#my-host
```

Review release/migration changes before enabling a newer Control binary.

### Generic systemd + Nix profile

For the TUI-first installation, upgrade the combined installer profile:

```sh
NIX_BIN="$(command -v nix)"
sudo "$NIX_BIN" profile upgrade \
  --profile /nix/var/nix/profiles/astrumweaver-installer \
  --all
```

If you intentionally installed separate role profiles, upgrade them instead:

```sh
NIX_BIN="$(command -v nix)"
sudo "$NIX_BIN" profile upgrade \
  --profile /nix/var/nix/profiles/astrumweaver-control \
  --all

NIX_BIN="$(command -v nix)"
sudo "$NIX_BIN" profile upgrade \
  --profile /nix/var/nix/profiles/astrumweaver-worker \
  --all
```

If the new Control binary contains new database migrations, run
`astrumweaver-migrate` before considering Control ready.

### Retrying an interrupted generic systemd first-run

This section is for the generic systemd helpers. Control defaults to the
`astrumweaver-control` user/group and `/var/lib/astrumweaver-control`; Worker
remains `astrumweaver` and `/var/lib/astrumweaver`. The shared
`/etc/astrumweaver` directory is `root:astrumweaver-config 0710` (traverse
only), while each role-managed file is `root:<role-group> 0640`. Both units
use `SupplementaryGroups=astrumweaver-config`, never the peer's private group.

Distinct custom `--user NAME` values are supported in either install order;
equal values are rejected before the second role changes anything. A live
existing account must have the same-name group as its primary group, with the
matching GID. An empty, pre-provisioned same-name group is reused with
`useradd --gid` when the account is created.
Setup enumerates `getent passwd` and `getent group` and rejects any differently
named entry sharing a role's numeric UID or private GID, including aliases of
the shared traversal group's GID. This check also covers an existing group
before its role user is created. Failed enumeration is rejected, not treated
as an empty identity database. The operator must still reserve numeric IDs
across all configured NSS sources: setup cannot certify non-enumerable remote
accounts or protect against a privileged administrator later granting access.
When both units already exist, each helper also requires the peer unit's live
user. Account and state migration is deliberate manual work; do not remove the
existing `astrumweaver` Worker account to make a retry pass.

Updating a Nix profile only updates binaries; it does not repair host files.
Re-running the updated setup helpers with the same reviewed inputs is the
normal fresh/retry path: it repairs `/etc/astrumweaver` to
`root:astrumweaver-config 0710`, state to the selected role ownership with
mode `0750`, and role config/env/GPU/runtime files to `root:<role-group> 0640`.
No world-readable permissions are needed.

The helpers deliberately refuse to overwrite different configuration or unit
content. In particular, an old role unit from the shared-account templates is
not silently replaced; follow the [manual role-separation migration](deployment.md#migrating-an-older-generic-systemd-installation)
instead. Do not regenerate Control tokens or discard existing secrets merely
to retry. For an earlier failed **smoke** install, stop the Worker and review
`/etc/astrumweaver/worker.toml` locally:

```sh
sudo systemctl stop astrumweaver-worker.service
sudoedit /etc/astrumweaver/worker.toml
```

Only when `[executor].factory` is
`astrumweaver.executors.structured_echo:create_executor`, set
`[worker].capabilities = ["debug.echo"]`. Preserve GPU ownership, identity,
Control URL and all other reviewed settings. Do not make this change to a
RuntimeProvider configuration. Then reconcile using the existing protected
files (omit the Control command on a Worker-only host):

```sh
sudo /nix/var/nix/profiles/astrumweaver-installer/bin/astrumweaver-setup-control-plane \
  --config /etc/astrumweaver/control.toml \
  --environment-file /etc/astrumweaver/control.env \
  --executable /nix/var/nix/profiles/astrumweaver-installer/bin/astrumweaver-control

sudo /nix/var/nix/profiles/astrumweaver-installer/bin/astrumweaver-setup-gpu-worker \
  --config /etc/astrumweaver/worker.toml \
  --environment-file /etc/astrumweaver/worker.env \
  --executable /nix/var/nix/profiles/astrumweaver-installer/bin/astrumweaver-worker \
  --start
```

Use each role's distinct reviewed `--user` if customized. If an installed unit uses a
different executable profile, keep that original stable executable path while
upgrading its profile, or explicitly review a unit migration; setup will not
silently replace it. For runtime retry, also pass the existing reviewed
`--runtime-manifest /etc/astrumweaver/runtime-deployment.json`; keep existing
isolation policy (`--gpu-isolation on` if explicitly enabled).
After reconciliation, restart already-running affected services to pick up
the updated binaries/configuration. If Control migration never completed,
finish the documented migration/start step before testing Worker registration.
Check `/v1/ready`, Worker `/health`, and the
[debug.echo round-trip](getting-started.md#verify-the-installation).

## What is not an installation method yet

### pip

The Python package can be useful for development, but a pip-only installation
does not currently constitute a complete supported host deployment because the
systemd/setup integration is packaged separately.

### copying setup scripts from the repository

This works for development but is not the preferred source-free deployment
path. Use the Nix `control` / `worker` packages, which include the reviewed
integration assets.

## Next

Once the binaries/services are installed, continue with:

[Getting Started — verify the installation](getting-started.md#verify-the-installation)
